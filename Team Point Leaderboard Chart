####Team Point Leaderboard####
#This is fundamental the same dashboard as the individual points dashboard, but when the points and qualification status 
are pulled, they're first bucketed by team based on predetermined pairings, then combined into the final table as rows 
for each team with new business, upsells, total, and qualification status columns calculated based on the results for the team
as a whole#
